Audio Processing Script
This Python script provides a user-friendly interface to process audio files in a specified input folder. It offers two primary functionalities:

**Functionality 1: Adjust Volume and Noise Reduction
**
Users can choose to adjust the volume of audio files by specifying the desired increase in decibels.
Optionally, noise reduction can be applied to the audio files.
The processed audio files are saved in the output folder.

**Functionality 2: Convert to Different Formats
**
Users can convert audio files to different formats by providing a list of target formats.
If the target formats input contains the keyword "python," the script will split the input to determine the target formats.
The converted audio files are saved in the output folder.
